💡 About Hacktoberfest

    Hacktoberfest is an annual celebration of open-source software where contributors around the world submit meaningful pull requests to improve projects they care about. Your participation helps keep the open-source ecosystem vibrant and thriving.

🤝 How to Contribute

    We encourage thoughtful, high-quality contributions that enhance the project. Some meaningful ways to participate include:
    Fixing small bugs or improving code readability
    Updating or refining documentation and configuration comments
    Improving user experience or file organization
    Suggesting minor enhancements that align with existing functionality

Before submitting your pull request, please:

    Fork the repository to your personal account (not an organization).
    Create a descriptive branch name such as feature/enhanced-config-docs or fix/config-comments.
    Follow the repository’s contribution and commit message guidelines.
    Open your pull request to the dev branch and include a short explanation of your improvement.

🧭 Good Practices

    Keep commits clear and meaningful.
    Avoid unnecessary formatting-only changes.
    Test any functionality updates before submitting.
    Respect existing design and code conventions.

🌟 Recognition

    All accepted pull requests count toward your Hacktoberfest goal, but more importantly, they help strengthen the CrazyEnchantments community and benefit thousands of users who enjoy the project.

    We appreciate your time, creativity, and passion for open source.
    Welcome aboard, and happy contributing! 💪
